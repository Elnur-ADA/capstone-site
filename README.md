# Capstone Project 2 — Personal Website (+CSS)

## What I did
- Unified `style.css` across all pages (Poppins font, 90% body width, centered background theme).
- Sticky navbar with hover effects + active state that doesn't change on hover.
- Circular profile (200px) with hover growth (220px).
- Dotted, centered `<hr>`.
- Education page table styling; list styling; Contact form styling with `:focus`.
- Pseudo-class (`:hover`, `:focus`) + pseudo-element (`h2::before`).
- Layouts (Option B): Home (Float+Position elements), Weekly (`schedule.html`, Grid), Gallery (Flexbox, responsive 3→1).
- Bootstrap page (`education-bootstrap.html`) using rows/cols, cards, buttons, utilities.

## What I learned
- Consistent theming with one stylesheet
- Grid vs Flexbox vs Float/Position
- Bootstrap trade-offs vs custom CSS

## Purpose
Personal website / practice project.
